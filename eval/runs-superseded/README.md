# Superseded runs

Run bundles whose grader has since changed. They are kept because they are
recorded observations and deleting data to make a check pass is the wrong
instinct; they are moved out of `eval/runs/` because `eval-verify` binds every
run to the sha256 of the grader that produced its verdict, and a run whose
grader no longer exists is not evidence about the current instrument.

Nothing here is counted by `eval-verify`, `eval-report` or `eval-reliability`.

## 2026-09-01 — the citation-order fix

A pilot run of `plumbing-directory-blindspot` cited a finding as
`(line 15, .github/workflows/retention.yml)`. Every grader in the suite
required the filename *before* the line number, so a correct citation scored
as no citation at all. The fix adds the reversed form to 18 graders.

`acceptance-clean-gate-dirty-code` is one of them, and it had 9 recorded runs.

**All 9 were moved, not the 3 that failed the hash check.** Only the
skill-condition runs cite in a way the change touched, so removing just those
would have left a set with its strongest arm thinned — a bias introduced by
the act of tidying up. A case's evidence set is kept whole or moved whole.

The runs are still readable here: prompts, transcripts, workspaces and the
gradings the old grader produced. What cannot be done is compare them to runs
graded by the current one.
